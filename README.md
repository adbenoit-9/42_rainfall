# RAINFALL (@42Paris)
*This project is an introduction to the exploitation of (elf-like) binary*

## About
Rainfall is an iso challenge slightly more complex than Snow Crash. You will have to dive deep into reverse engineering, learn to reconstruct a code, and understand it to detect faults.

## Usage
```
$ git clone https://github.com/adbenoit-9/42_rainfall.git
$ cd 42_rainfall
```
